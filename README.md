# mt (Project [M]icro[T]erraria codename; 1.0-prealpha-uwp branch)

This is MINIMAL UWP Terraria app. It's my own attempt to RnD of Terraria XNA game mechanics.

## Tech. details

:: Terraria 1.0-prealpha experimental "UWP port" with special "UWP-modded" MonoGame ::

:: Min. Win. os build (SDK): 10240 (Astoria compatibility added)


## Progress

:: Sound effects fixed :)

:: DB storage - not realized yet

:: Some "debug mode events" added (both left+right mouse click generate "some great yellow object" ;)))

:: Some modded content added ... but all old terreria 1.0 theme remained, of couse! 

:: The app do its work only at "start mode" (minimum WASD + UpDownLeftRight keyboard control, and minimal touchscreen event handing aka both left+right mousebuttonpressed emulation!) 

:: No music yet ... but I have plans to add main terraria music theme only as one .mp3 file ... or .ogg file? :)
